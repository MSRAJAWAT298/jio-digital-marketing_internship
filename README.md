Jio has launched a Student Learning Program - Digital Champions, which provides a unique opportunity to students to gain  practical experience in their non-academic / extra-curricular time to complement their academic learning. The students,  through the program, will learn practical problem solving skills which they can apply in real world business challenges.    During this program, the students shall visit and interact with Small and Medium Businesses (SMBs) to understand how the  digital revolution has impacted their businesses. They will also try to understand, through these interactions, how the SMBs  function and what expectations they have from the digital revolution.
